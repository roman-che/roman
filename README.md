<p align="center">Welcome to my github page</p>

I build software which runs complex and interactive contraptions for escape room games, edutainment projects, interactive museums and control systems for game masters. I keep abreast with current and emerging methods and technologies by researching and finding new ways of stacking concurrent operations to implement in real-life gaming and entertainment systems. I am humbled that my work brings unforgettable experience and joy for the players of my games.
